    <h3>Just a little bit about me and what this page will entail!</h3>
    
    <main>
        <p>My name is Xavier Frazier, and I am a senior at the University of Missouri ~ Columbia. <strong>I am majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in Mathematics and Computer Science.</strong> My estimated completion date for my degree and minors is December 2024. I hope to enter a field related to security or technology in engineering. I have major interests in cybersecurity, government defense and security, all kinds of tech (both hardware and software), web and coding development, wiring diagrams, and problem-solving within the engineering field.
        
        <br>I have been exposed to mathematics and engineering essentially all my life, which has played a significant role and strong influence on my decisions throughout high school, college, and beyond. I have dedicated my time in school, along with a few internships, to learn, apply what I have previously learned, and polish skills that I feel I already have. I continue to strive for growth and excellence in these areas as I move forward in my career.</p>
