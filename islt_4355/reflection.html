        <h2>My Career Reflection</h2>
            <p>My academic journey has been shaped by a deep-rooted passion for problem-solving, technology, and engineering. From an early age, my exposure to mathematics and engineering concepts significantly influenced my path through high school and into college. This foundation has driven me to explore various paths of engineering, ultimately sparking an interest in cybersecurity, defense, and security, as well as a wide range of technology applications. My goal is to transition into a career in the tech or security sectors, where I can continue to challenge myself and apply the skills I’ve developed throughout my academic and professional experiences.</p>
            <p>Throughout my time in college, I’ve had the opportunity of engaging in internships that have not only strengthened my knowledge but also allowed me to apply classroom theories to real-world situations. At The Boeing Company, I gained expertise in military standards and aircraft compliance, particularly focusing on government defense projects. My role involved analyzing technical documentation, wiring diagrams, and supporting the qualification process for mission-critical devices in international aircraft. This experience helped my ability to work within regulatory standards while contributing to enhancing the operational reliability of global defense systems. Additionally, during my time at Commonwealth Edison (Exelon), I got into power distribution and infrastructure management. By modeling a 26-mile underground fiber route and conducting cost-benefit analyses, I learned the intricacies of optimizing both overhead and underground utilities. These opportunities solidified my passion for problem-solving and gave me a comprehensive understanding of various engineering domains.</p>
            <p>In addition to my internships, I’ve gained valuable experience on campus through my work with the Disability Center and as a Teaching Assistant for the First-Year Engineering program. At the Disability Center, I developed a strong sense of responsibility and empathy, supporting students with diverse needs while strictly adhering to FERPA guidelines. My role required balancing confidentiality with the assurance of academic integrity, which helped me strengthen my communication and organizational skills. Meanwhile, as a Teaching Assistant, I have enjoyed mentoring first-year and transfer students as they embark on their engineering journey. By helping them navigate foundational concepts and coursework, I’ve been able to give back to the program that shaped my own early experiences while reinforcing my leadership and teaching abilities.</p>
            <p>As I approach the final chapter of my undergraduate education, my career aspirations are becoming clearer. I envision myself working at the intersection of technology and security, whether that be within the realms of cybersecurity, government defense, or broader tech applications. My passion for both hardware and software, coupled with my interest in web development, coding, and technical problem-solving, drives my pursuit of a career where I can continuously learn and innovate. I am excited to leverage the technical knowledge and practical experience I’ve gained to contribute to cutting-edge projects that protect critical systems and improve technological efficiency on a global scale.</p>
<h3>Career Goals</h3>
        <p>I hope to find a stable job in either tech, cybersecurity or defense. I want to be able to keep progessing in my career, improving my personal & professional technical and soft skils to contrubute to a company both short & long term.</p>
