These internships have given me a great insight into what my desired profession may look like after college. I have gained plenty of experience in all three of my internships that I will use wherever I end up post gradutation. I am so grateful and blessed to have had the privelage to be employed by these companies that gave me the opportunities to learn, contribute, and showcase the skills and knowledge that I have obtained from my undergraduate career.
