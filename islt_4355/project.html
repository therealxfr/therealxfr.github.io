These internships have given me a great insight into what my desired profession may look like after college. I have gained plenty of experience in all three of my internships that I will use wherever I end up post gradutation. I am so grateful and blessed to have had the privelage to be employed by these companies that gave me the opportunities to learn, contribute, and showcase the skills and knowledge that I have obtained from my undergraduate career.

        <h1>Internship Background</h1>
        <h3>The Boeing Company</h3>
        <p>Actively studied military standards for government aircraft requests. Prepared Statements of Work, analyzed drawings, documents, and wiring diagrams for AWACS aircraft, and supported the LRU Qualification process, ensuring the testing and approval of devices used in aircraft for missions across different countries. Also, performed some 3D modeling of an audio receiver with correct measurements to be installed on aircraft to improve communication between individuals on and between aircrafts, creating a better more secure connection between very high frequency (VHF) radios. In addition, supported the AEW&C aircraft creating a risk assessment to raise approval level for a marked item of The Boeing Company.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on my experience working with government aircraft requests, I gained a deep understanding of military standards and developed key skills in analyzing technical drawings, documents, and wiring diagrams for AWACS aircraft. Preparing Statements of Work and supporting the LRU Qualification process allowed me to contribute to critical testing and approval stages for devices used in international missions. I also had the opportunity to engage in 3D modeling, ensuring precise measurements for an audio receiver that improved communication between aircraft. Additionally, supporting AEW&C aircraft risk assessments sharpened my ability to assess and manage risks, enhancing approval processes for critical components. This experience significantly strengthened my technical skills and broadened my understanding of aerospace systems.</p>
        <h3>Commonwealth Edison</h3>
        <p>During this experience, I consistently developed a comprehensive understanding of several key components within utility infrastructure and electrical systems. This included gaining knowledge about permit proposals, interpreting cross-section maps, and understanding the role and design of manholes. I also learned the distinctions between overhead and underground systems, along with relevant applications such as TED. I contributed to modeling a 26-mile underground fiber route, focusing on optimizing the placement of ducts to reduce costs through careful cost-benefit analysis. Additionally, I acquired insights into transformers, fuses, plenty of other power components and the communication requirements necessary to enhance power distribution efficiency by as much as 40%.</p>
        <p>During this experience, I really deepened my understanding of utility infrastructure, especially in areas like permit proposals, cross-section maps, and the differences between overhead and underground systems. Working on the 26-mile underground fiber route was a great challenge, but it helped me develop practical skills in optimizing duct placement and using cost-benefit analysis to make impactful decisions. I also learned a lot about transformers, fuses, and communication requirements, which opened my eyes to how critical these components are in improving power distribution efficiency. This hands-on work not only strengthened my technical abilities but also gave me confidence in managing real-world engineering projects.</p>
        <h3>Wight & Co.</h3>
        <p>I gained valuable insight into the weekly preplanning process and the day-to-day aspects of construction management. This involved coordinating with various companies specializing in materials like glass and concrete. I actively participated in meetings with these external companies, which allowed me to deepen my understanding of the collaborative nature of construction projects. I learned about essential safety regulations and the importance of maintaining site diversity. I also became familiar with pricing discussions, tracking work progress, and assessing efficiency. Additionally, I gained an appreciation for managing critical deadlines, ensuring that all aspects of the project stayed on track to meet the established timelines.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on my experience in construction management, I gained a solid understanding of how different aspects of a project come together. From coordinating with companies specializing in glass and concrete to participating in meetings, I learned the importance of collaboration in construction. I also developed skills in tracking work progress, handling pricing discussions, and evaluating project efficiency. Additionally, understanding safety regulations and the value of maintaining site diversity gave me a broader perspective on managing a successful project. Meeting tight deadlines was another challenge that taught me the importance of strategic planning and organization to keep everything moving smoothly. At the end of the day, I decided that Construction Management, or Civil Engineering as a whole was just not for me and decided to go a different route. However, I am extremely grateful for the opportunity and glad that I was able to realize early that what I liked and didnâ€™t like.</p>
